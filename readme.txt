MULTILLM GATEWAY
A multi-language model gateway that allows users to interact with various AI language models through a web interface.
Implementation Details and Approach
The project consists of two main components:
Frontend
A web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that provides a chat interface for users to interact with AI models. It includes features like:
•	Message history
•	Conversation saving
•	A sidebar for saved conversations
Backend
A Flask API that:
•	Handles requests from the frontend
•	Interfaces with various language models
•	Manages logging and provider configuration
The system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new language model providers.
Usage Instructions
Prerequisites:
•	Python 3.6+
•	Node.js
•	Flask
•	Requests library
•	Transformers library
•	PyYAML
•	Flask-CORS
Setup:
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multillm-gateway.git
cd multillm-gateway

# Install requirements.txt 
pip install flask requests transformers pyyaml flask-cors

# Install JavaScript dependencies
npm install marked
Configuration:
•	Create a providers.yaml file with your language model provider configurations.
•	Set up any required API keys in the configuration file.
Running the Application:
# Start the Flask server
python src/app.py
Then, open the web interface in your browser:
http://localhost:5000
Assumptions, Limitations, and Edge Cases
Assumptions:
•	All language model providers have a REST API endpoint.
•	API keys are properly configured and secured.
•	The system will be used in a controlled environment with reasonable traffic.
Limitations:
•	Currently supports a limited set of language models.
•	No user authentication implemented.
•	Basic error handling for provider failures.
•	No rate limiting implemented.
Edge Cases:
•	Very long prompts that need summarization.
•	Providers with different response formats.
•	Network timeouts and retries.
•	Concurrent access to the same conversation.
Dependencies and Additional Notes
Dependencies:
•	Python libraries: Flask, requests, transformers, pyyaml, flask-cors
•	JavaScript libraries: marked
•	CSS: Custom styling included in the HTML file
Additional Notes:
•	The system uses local storage for conversation history.
•	Logs are stored in a CSV file for later analysis.
•	The provider configuration file (providers.yaml) controls which language models are used.
•	The system includes basic error handling and retry logic for provider failures.
This implementation provides a foundation for a multi-language model gateway that can be extended with additional features and providers as needed.
